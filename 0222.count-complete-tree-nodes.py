#
# Given the root of a complete binary tree, return the number of the nodes in
# the tree.
#
# According to Wikipedia, every level, except possibly the last, is completely
# filled in a complete binary tree, and all nodes in the last level are as far
# left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2^h nodes inclusive at the last
# level h.
#
# Design an algorithm that runs in less than O(n) time complexity.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
# Output: 6
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: root = []
# Output: 0
#
#
# Example 3:
#
#
# Input: root = [1]
# Output: 1
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 5 * 10^4].
# 0 <= Node.val <= 5 * 10^4
# The tree is guaranteed to be complete.
