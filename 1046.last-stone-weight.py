#
# You are given an array of integers stones where stones[i] is the weight of
# the i^th stone.
#
# We are playing a game with the stones. On each turn, we choose the heaviest
# two stones and smash them together. Suppose the heaviest two stones have
# weights x and y with x <= y. The result of this smash is:
#
#
# If x == y, both stones are destroyed, and
# If x != y, the stone of weight x is destroyed, and the stone of weight y has
# new weight y - x.
#
#
# At the end of the game, there is at most one stone left.
#
# Return the smallest possible weight of the left stone. If there are no stones
# left, return 0.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: stones = [2,7,4,1,8,1]
# Output: 1
# Explanation:
# We combine 7 and 8 to get 1 so the array converts to [2,4,1,1,1] then,
# we combine 2 and 4 to get 2 so the array converts to [2,1,1,1] then,
# we combine 2 and 1 to get 1 so the array converts to [1,1,1] then,
# we combine 1 and 1 to get 0 so the array converts to [1] then that's the
# value of the last stone.
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: stones = [1]
# Output: 1
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# 1 <= stones.length <= 30
# 1 <= stones[i] <= 1000
