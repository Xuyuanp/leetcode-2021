#
# Given an array of distinct integers nums and a target integer target, return
# the number of possible combinations that add up to target.
#
# The answer is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: nums = [1,2,3], target = 4
# Output: 7
# Explanation:
# The possible combination ways are:
# (1, 1, 1, 1)
# (1, 1, 2)
# (1, 2, 1)
# (1, 3)
# (2, 1, 1)
# (2, 2)
# (3, 1)
# Note that different sequences are counted as different combinations.
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: nums = [9], target = 3
# Output: 0
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# 1 <= nums.length <= 200
# 1 <= nums[i] <= 1000
# All the elements of nums are unique.
# 1 <= target <= 1000
#
#
#
# Follow up: What if negative numbers are allowed in the given array? How does
# it change the problem? What limitation we need to add to the question to
# allow negative numbers?
