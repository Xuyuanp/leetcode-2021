# Testcase Example:  '"ADOBECODEBANC"\n"ABC"'
#
# Given two strings s and t of lengths m and n respectively, return the minimum
# window substring of s such that every character in t (including duplicates)
# is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return the empty
# string "".
#
# The testcases will be generated such that the answer is unique.
#
# A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
# Output: "BANC"
# Explanation: The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C'
# from string t.
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: s = "a", t = "a"
# Output: "a"
# Explanation: The entire string s is the minimum window.
#
#
# Example 3:
#
#
# Input: s = "a", t = "aa"
# Output: ""
# Explanation: Both 'a's from t must be included in the window.
# Since the largest window of s only has one 'a', return empty string.
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# m == s.length
# n == t.length
# 1 <= m, nÂ <= 10^5
# s and t consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters.
#
#
#
# Follow up: Could you find an algorithm that runs in O(m + n) time?
