#
# Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.
#
# There are n stones in a pile. On each player's turn, they can remove a stone
# from the pile and receive points based on the stone's value. Alice and Bob
# may value the stones differently.
#
# You are given two integer arrays of length n, aliceValues and bobValues. Each
# aliceValues[i] and bobValues[i] represents how Alice and Bob, respectively,
# value the i^th stone.
#
# The winner is the person with the most points after all the stones are
# chosen. If both players have the same amount of points, the game results in a
# draw. Both players will play optimally.Â Both players know the other's
# values.
#
# Determine the result of the game, and:
#
#
# If Alice wins, return 1.
# If Bob wins, return -1.
# If the game results in a draw, return 0.
#
#
#
# Example 1:
#
#
# Input: aliceValues = [1,3], bobValues = [2,1]
# Output: 1
# Explanation:
# If Alice takes stone 1 (0-indexed) first, Alice will receive 3 points.
# Bob can only choose stone 0, and will only receive 2 points.
# Alice wins.
#
#
# Example 2:
#
#
# Input: aliceValues = [1,2], bobValues = [3,1]
# Output: 0
# Explanation:
# If Alice takes stone 0, and Bob takes stone 1, they will both have 1 point.
# Draw.
#
#
# Example 3:
#
#
# Input: aliceValues = [2,4,3], bobValues = [1,6,7]
# Output: -1
# Explanation:
# Regardless of how Alice plays, Bob will be able to have more points than
# Alice.
# For example, if Alice takes stone 1, Bob can take stone 2, and Alice takes
# stone 0, Alice will have 6 points to Bob's 7.
# Bob wins.
#
#
#
# Constraints:
#
#
# n == aliceValues.length == bobValues.length
# 1 <= n <= 10^5
# 1 <= aliceValues[i], bobValues[i] <= 100
#
#
